# Automated Month-End Reporting Pipeline
### Excel VBA automation replacing manual month-end consolidation — Financial Services Business Unit

---

## What this project does

This project automates the monthly expense reporting process for a financial services business unit. A VBA macro reads 500 raw transactions, validates data quality, categorises expenditure, calculates budget vs actual variances, flags items requiring review, and outputs a formatted P&L summary and executive dashboard — in under 60 seconds.

**The business problem it solves:** Finance teams spend 2–4 hours every month manually consolidating transaction exports, building variance tables, and formatting management reports. This pipeline reduces that to a single button click.

## Dataset

**500 transactions** across a 12-month financial year (FY2024) covering:

- 10 departments: Retail Banking, Business Banking, Wealth Management, Insurance, Markets, Operations, IT, HR, Finance, Risk
- 6 expense categories: Staff Costs, Technology, Occupancy, Professional Fees, Marketing, Operations
- Fields: transaction ID, month, department, category, subcategory, vendor, actual amount, budget amount, variance, status, approver

**Transaction status flags:**
- `On Track` — variance within 5% of budget
- `Monitor` — variance between 5–15%
- `Review Required` — variance exceeds 15%
- `Approved` — pre-approved line items (e.g. salaries)
